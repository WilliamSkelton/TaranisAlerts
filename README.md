# TaranisAlerts
TaranisAlerts - PHP and Python

This was a quick two day project to create a simple alert via email webapp that utilizes HTML, PHP, MySQL, and Python to create an easy to use web interface for the purposes of coordinating and farming boss spawns in the Celtic Heroes. This project showcases usage of common SQL queries, a system of preventing clock drift serverside, as well as implementation of Unix Epoch time to ensure consistency across timezones.
